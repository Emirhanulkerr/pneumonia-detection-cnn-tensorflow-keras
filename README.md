# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN
Pneumonia Detection Using CNN  This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify chest X-ray images into Normal and Pneumonia categories. The model uses data augmentation to improve generalization and is trained and validated on labeled chest X-ray datasets.
